This is a weather application for the Financial Times junior engineer role.
I used `Express` to run the server and `Handlebars` for the engine view.
The application is live in [`here`](https://weather-app-amir.herokuapp.com/)
# How to run the app locally
To run the app locally you need to first run `npm install` in your terminal in this folder to install all the dependencies.Afterward, if you run `npm start` you can see the prompt in the console that the `server is running ov port 4545` and if you open the browser and go to [`localhost:4545`](localhost:4545) you can see the app.
